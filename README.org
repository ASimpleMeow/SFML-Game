#+TITLE: SFML Game

This is a game created in [[https://www.sfml-dev.org/][SFML]] using various external libraries such as:
- [[https://github.com/ocornut/imgui][ImGui]]
- [[https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D][Box2D]]

* Expected Features
- Entity Component design pattern - *DONE*
- Tiling (map) - *DONE*
- Asset Manager (for loading in textures,etc) - *DONE*
- Procedural Level Generation (see disclaimers) - *DONE*
- AI:
  - Influence Map (Bonus) - *NOT DONE*
  - A* Algorithm - *DONE*
  - Path Following, Wandering, etc - *DONE* (AI wandering around by following random points in the level)
- Memory Mangement (memory pools) - *DONE* (Data Locality Pattern & Memory Object Pools)
- Networking (basic replication of other players position) - *DONE*
- Sound Effects - *DONE* (With locailisation)
- Music - *DONE*
- Menus (GUI) - *DONE*

* Disclaimers
Many parts of this project use [[https://github.com/utilForever/ProceduralContentGeneration][Chris Ohk's]] code from his *ProceduralContentGeneration* repository, either as a baseline to get the projected started, or as libraries 
for this project. However, the taken parts are improved upon and adjusted to suit this project's goals.

Additionally, in order to save time on designing and developing levels for various floors I implemented procedural level generation based on *Dale Green's* book 
[[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/procedural-content-generation/9781785886713/][Procedural Content Generation for C++ Game Development]].
