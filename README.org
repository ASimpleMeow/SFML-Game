#+TITLE: SFML Game

This is a game created in [[https://www.sfml-dev.org/][SFML]] using various external libraries such as:
- [[https://github.com/ocornut/imgui][ImGui]]
- [[https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog][NativeFileDialog]]
- [[https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D][Box2D]]

* Expected Features
- Entity Component design pattern
- Tiling (map)
- Asset Manager (for loading in textures,etc)
- Procedural Level Generation (see disclaimers)
- AI:
  - Influence Map
  - A* Algorithm
  - Path Following, Wandering, etc
- Memory Mangement (memory pools)
- Networking (basic replication of other players position)
- Sound Effects
- Music
- Menus (GUI)

* Disclaimers
Many parts of this project use [[https://github.com/utilForever/ProceduralContentGeneration][Chris Ohk's]] code from his *ProceduralContentGeneration* repository, either as a baseline to get the projected started, or as libraries 
for this project. However, the taken parts are improved upon and adjusted to suit this project's goals.

Additionally, in order to save time on designing and developing levels for various floors I implemented procedural level generation based on *Dale Green's* book 
[[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/procedural-content-generation/9781785886713/][Procedural Content Generation for C++ Game Development]].
